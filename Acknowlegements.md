#### Easing Functions
Shout Out to Andrey Sitnik and Ivan Solovev at https://easings.net/
Their awesome informational site is the basis for the Easing Functions that
are included by default.

#### Quaternions
Shout outs here to 3Blue1Brown and Ben Eater at https://eater.net/quaternions
Quaternions are a *weird* mathematical model that give me a headache.
Even interacting with them in Godot is frustrating.
Their interactive video sets on this stuff really help me understand it.
